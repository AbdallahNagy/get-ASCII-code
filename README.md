# get-ASCII-code
this is a simple program to get the ASCII code of most of the  keys on your keyboard.

it should be like this:
![ascii](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69394675/201787936-ed817b29-9e9d-40bd-82c8-d57f20ac2f16.png)

you press any key and it will output the ASCII code as expected.
